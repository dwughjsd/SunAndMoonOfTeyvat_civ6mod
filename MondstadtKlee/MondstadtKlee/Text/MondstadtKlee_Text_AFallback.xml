There are even those that go so far to say that she is the most powerful within the Knights of Favonius.

She even taught her how to place explosive charges to bring the whole Starsnatch Cliff down and stuck their tongues out at each other awkwardly while being told off by Knights of Favonius.</Text>

Since then, the legend of the "Red Knight of the Stormbearer Mountains" began to circulate around Mondstadt.

			<Text>At least 3,000 years before the Traveler’s arrival, Decarabian, the God of Storms, founded the nation of Mondstadt. That was a time when the region of Mondstadt is filled with blizzards, and humans had to seek gods for protection. Decarabian establishes his capital city in the area later known as Stormterror's Lair and created a storm wall around it to protect his city. The city was built in a ring-shape and is thought to be divided into 3 rings, with each ring having different functions. Right in the center of the city was the tall tower where Decarabian resided. The original scope of Old Mondstadt's territory encompassed the Brightcrown Mountains and Windwail Highland areas and went to the southern area between Liyue and Dawn Winery nowadays.</Text>

Venti became the new Anemo Archon called Barbatos. After becoming a new Archon, Barbatos reshaped Mondstadt, using his winds to blow away the snow and ice covering the land and terraforming the region of Mondstadt in the process. He then took his people from Decarabian's old city and moved to Cider Lake, where they build the modern city of Mondstadt. After that, prominent clans, which later arose as leaders of Mondstadt, such as the Gunnhildr Clan and the Lawrence Clan, are found by some renowned rebels.</Text>

Many of the festivals and customs in Mondstadt were enacted by the aristocracy for the betterment of the common people. Commonplace were the hunts, a hobby of the ruling class of Mondstadt. The festivities were shared with their servants and the common folk as a sign of the benevolence of the nobles. Ludi Harpastum and Windblume also trace back to this era.</Text>

Barbatos who previously departed and slumbered heard the prayers and cries of the oppressed and descended on Mondstadt under the guise of Venti.

Regretfully, as peace time erodes the history again, the worship of the Four Winds faded away, and temples built for them were abandoned. 500 years after the Knights of Favonius was founded, Durin, a shadow dragon, invaded Mondstadt, and awakened Barbatos who summoned Dvalin to come to their aid again. Dvalin was grievously injured in battle and was forgotten by Mondstadt people for the next 500 years.</Text>

Advancements of alcohol industry created a wide array of alcoholic beverages and soft drinks.

For Sumeru, the first thing of all is to occupy as many Rainforest tiles as possible, so that they can use Forest Rangers to harvest a large amount of [ICON_Production] Production and [ICON_Science] Science. The Akademiya district can push their technological advantages even further. When playing as Nahida, remember to choose a good location for your city centers to gain additional yields. With the leadership of Mahakusaladhamma, Sumeru will surely prosper - and a Science Victory is in their reach.</Text>

Further, her Gnosis, proof of an archon's status, was used to maintain the Akasha system, a device developed by Greater Lord Rukkhadevata that can collect and share people’s knowledge. The Akasha system became the ears and eyes of the newborn deity. The Akasha enables her to observe and learn about people's emotions and gives her omnipresent sight and hearing so that she can understand voices that are not praise. She is aware of their devotion to the old goddess, their disillusionment with their new deity, and the many comments that “The God of Wisdom will never come back.”</Text>

In his eyes, if Lesser Lord Kusanali has no ability to save Irminsul, people should create a new deity who has the ability. They used an Electro Gnosis to build a body for the new deity based on original construction of The Balladeer, a mechanical puppet. To create the new deity, the Akademiya even used the Akasha system to harvest Sumeru people’s dreams.</Text>

At the border between the forest and the desert, the Wall of Samiel was erected to prevent the forest from undergoing desertification. With the help of her followers who would go on to establish the Amurta Darshan of Sumeru Akademiya, Rukkhadevata developed a flourishing rainforest. Sumeru City was built on the Divine Tree, a particularly massive tree located in Sumeru's forest region, and the sages of Sumeru Akademiya assisted Rukkhadevata in managing the nation's affairs.

Greater Lord Rukkhadevata knew that she cannot repel it with her sole power, so she created a device which gather wisdom of humanity and named it Akasha.

Each Darshan was established under one of the names of Six Great Schools and is led by a Great Sage. Among them a Grand Sage is elected and become the absolute leader of the Akademiya. Obtaining a degree from the Akademiya is a notoriously long and stressful process. It is not uncommon for people to graduate after the age of 30, and the stress presses many students’ hair to turn gray. Lesser Lord Kusanali was isolated by Akademiya after her birth until the Traveler rescued her. Later she took back the leadership of this organization and exiled Azar, the then-Grand Sage.</Text>
